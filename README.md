# Lab 3_CS231

# This lab involves user defined functions and offers the user a set of calculations relating to a circle. The use gets to choose if they want to calculate the area, circumference, and diameter by providing the radius. The user can also quit the function if they so choose.

## How to run the app
1. Download or Fork the .cpp file
2. Download a C++ IDE editor if you do not already have one
3. Open your editor and open the .cpp file
4. go to execute and compile and run the file, which will bring up the command prompt
5. use the program

## How to use the program
1. the program will give you 4 options to choose from
2. choose either option 1,2,3, or -1(or option 4)
3. the program will then ask you to input the radius of your choosing
4. depending on what you chose, the program will output the area, circumference, or diameter of a circle based on the radius you provided

## User Stories
1. users can use this program to determine differenct calculations surrounding a circle
2. the interface is simple and straight to the point
3. the user gets to choose the radius they want to use, so it is flexible in that way

## features
1. the user can determine the area, circumference, and diameter of a circle
2. the program uses functions
3. this tool can be used for a number of different calculations and situations

## dependencies
